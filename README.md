# AlphaZeroCheckers
A University Project

## Overview
an AI for the board game known as American Checkers. 

## Getting Started
To start, run main.py. You will be presented with a menu of 2 choices.

## Generating 

## Testing

The program has 3 agents, a random agent, a human agent and an MCTS agent that uses the model saved as 'AlphaZeroCheckersModel'
To test, choose 2 on the main menu, and then select all parameteres as prompted. Console visualisation is possible. For more MCTS simulations per turn, the code for the MCTS agent must be modified in agent.py.




Checkers library and mcts library used as template and modified
